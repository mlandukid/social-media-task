Dear John Doe,

Subject: Discussing Integration Requirements for Your FinTech Mobile Product


I hope this email finds you well. As we move forward with integrating our component into your FinTech mobile product, Iâ€™d like to gather some specific details to ensure our collaboration is as effective and efficient as possible.

Understanding your product's transaction flows is crucial for us. Could you provide insights on the following:

Nature of Transaction Flows: How many types of transaction flows does your product handle?

Volume and Velocity: What's the expected frequency and volume of these transactions?

Variability: How similar or diverse are these transactions in terms of data structure?

These details will guide us in deciding the most suitable integration approach. We're considering two options:

Streaming/Real-time Endpoint: This ensures immediate data handling but requires more maintenance and infrastructure. It might also necessitate more involvement from your technical team.
Nightly Batch Upload: A simpler, less resource-intensive option, but with delayed data processing.
Your insights will also help us determine if a single data schema is sufficient or if we need multiple schemas to accommodate the variety of transactions.

We understand that your project is currently facing time and budget constraints. In line with this, we are exploring efficient solutions such as:

AWS S3: For handling high-velocity and unpredictable upload patterns.
AWS Lambda: A serverless function that allows us to write code with scalable, always-up endpoints without worrying about infrastructure.
NoSQL Database: Offers flexible schema options and can handle unrelated data efficiently.
These solutions aim to balance cost-effectiveness with the need for scalability and flexibility, ensuring that we don't over-provision resources while still preparing for your anticipated growth.

Your feedback is essential in making these decisions. We strive to avoid any unexpected costs or workload in the future by planning effectively now. Please let us know a convenient time for a call to discuss this further, or feel free to share your thoughts via email.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

Many Thanks 
Loyiso
